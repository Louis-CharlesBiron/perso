// YES TODO
- shapes
- follow functions
- simple collision / reflections
- on dot hover
- text connections
- rotate shape

- make another dedicated repos for this project



// ADJUSTMENTS / PERFORMANCE ?
- shape setup() function    -> avoid shape related global vars outside of the new Shape() call
- shape onSetup()           -> ex: setStaticConnections for dots














// MAYBE
- some sort of shape editor ~
- something like gd frame animation for ratioPos
- keyboard implementations
- text?
