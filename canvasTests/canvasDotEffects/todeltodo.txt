// YES TODO
- follow functions
- on dot hover / click
- rotate shape
- good support for custom ratioPos source (ball)
- shape see center but good (prob useing draw())

- make another dedicated repos for this project
- fix scaling


// ADJUSTMENTS / PERFORMANCE ?
- shape setup() function    -> avoid shape related global vars outside of the new Shape() call
- shape onSetup()           -> ex: setStaticConnections for dots








// MAYBE
- ratioPos depending on multiple pos
- simple collision / reflections
- some sort of shape editor ~
- something like gd frame animation for ratioPos
- keyboard implementations
- module version?
