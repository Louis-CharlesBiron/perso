// YES TODO
- shapes
- follow functions
- simple collision / reflections
- on dot hover
- text connections~
- rotate shape

- make another dedicated repos for this project



// ADJUSTMENTS / PERFORMANCE ?
- shape setup() function    -> avoid shape related global vars outside of the new Shape() call
- shape onSetup()           -> ex: setStaticConnections for dots


small todo
- shape center pos
- "fix"/adjust scaling

- don't auto draw dot connections
- finish up the Letter class / functions
- fix the: if the letter's first dot isn't at 0 then spawns higher













// MAYBE
- some sort of shape editor ~
- something like gd frame animation for ratioPos
- keyboard implementations
- text?
