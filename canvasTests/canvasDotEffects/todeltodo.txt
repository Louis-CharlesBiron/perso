// YES TODO
- follow functions
- on dot hover / click
- rotate shape
- good support for custom ratioPos source (ball)
- shape show center

- make another dedicated repos for this project

- shape center pos
- "fix"/adjust scaling

- finish up the Letter class / functions

fix letter pos

// ADJUSTMENTS / PERFORMANCE ?
- shape setup() function    -> avoid shape related global vars outside of the new Shape() call
- shape onSetup()           -> ex: setStaticConnections for dots








// MAYBE
- simple collision / reflections
- some sort of shape editor ~
- something like gd frame animation for ratioPos
- keyboard implementations
