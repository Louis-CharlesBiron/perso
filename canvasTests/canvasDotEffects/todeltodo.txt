// YES TODO
- follow functions
- on dot hover / click
- filled shapes
- rotate shape

- fix scaling

// ADJUSTMENTS / PERFORMANCE ?

- ex: adotshape, move shape pos when dot moves? see similar situations
- make the ratioPos object (mouse or anything else) have all the mouse's current infos?





- make another dedicated repos for this project

// MAYBE
- non square grid sources
- ratioPos depending on multiple pos
- simple collision / reflections
- some sort of shape editor ~
- something like gd frame animation for ratioPos
- keyboard implementations
- module version?
